 * CODING CHALLENGE 3

/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)

GOOD LUCK 😀
*/

function calculateTip(bill) {
  var percentage;
  if (bill < 50) {
    percentage = 0.2;
  } else if (bill >= 50 && bill < 200) {
    percentage = 0.15;
  } else {
    percentage = 0.1;
  }

  return percentage * bill;
}

var bills = [124, 48, 268];
var tips = [calculateTip(bills[0]), calculateTip(bills[1]), calculateTip(bills[2])];
var finalValues = [bills[0] + tips[0], bills[1] + tips[1], bills[2] + tips[2]];

console.log({ bills, tips, finalValues });
